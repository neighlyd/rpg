# rpg
Just a playground text RPG to learn things.

Requirements: Python 3.6+

So far I have implemented an infinitely expanding world map, randomly spawning zones, rooms and monsters, simplistic (unbalanced) combat, an inventory system, and a loot system.

In the future, I plan to differentiate the classes, introduce additional zones, rooms, and monsters, add in room items and traps, and put in as many stupid features to make the "game" more fun as I can think them up (spells for wizards, armor inscription for fighters, health potions, damage over time, etc.).

Like I said, this is just a stupid little game for me to practice coding.
